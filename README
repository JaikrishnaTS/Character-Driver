Advanced Systems Programming Homework 4

Description:
	The attached files implement a character device driver which supports many number of devices (as defined by NUM_DEVICES module parameter) and the following functions

	read, write, lseek, ioctl

	ioctl can be used to change the direction of data access to regular(0) or reverse(1)

	The attached example test application testmod.c accesses the device (device path as the first argument) and can perform all the functions on the device. 

	The simple test can be made by loading the driver and then using echo and cat.

	For example,
		$ make
		$ sudo insmod char_driver.ko
		$ sudo -s
		# echo "hello world" > /dev/mycdrv0
		# cat /dev/mycdrv0

	For advanced usage such as with ioctl, look at the example user application testmod.c and the output log output.txt

	For specifying a custom size for device use the module parameter RAMDISK_SIZE
